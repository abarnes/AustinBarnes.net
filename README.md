My personal website, built with Bootstrap+SASS. Feel free to browse the code!

I based this design on a previous site template I had used and updated it to better suite my needs and also work across mobile devices using Bootstrap.

As a portfolio site, it does not utilize my backend programming skills. Feel free to browser other repositories for examples of PHP & other coding.
